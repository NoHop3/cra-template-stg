A quick start Create React App template with React Router, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, React Testing Library, styled-components, MUI, storybook and custom ESlint configurations. As well as Husky & Commitizen so you can keep deploying your code in the best way possible.

# Changelog

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/NoHop3/cra-template-stg/issues) if you see something that needs improvement or witness a bug with the template

## How to install? Prerequisities

You MUST have : `node & npm`

After successfully installing node run the following command:

```
npm install yarn -g
```

This will install yarn globally.

Next head over to the folder where you would like to use cra-template-stg. 

Press `Alt+D` type in `cmd` press `Enter` and after the terminal appears type in the following:
```
yarn create react-app . --template stg
```
Change `.` with your project name if desired.

You might get a message `This will install create-react-app...` just press `Enter` to continue

## Initial setup

You can start the project after the scripts are done
```
yarn run start
```
Or directly start developing in VSCode
```
code .
```

## Husky & Commitizen initialization


Type in the following if you chose a desired name:
```
cd *your project name* && yarn run husky-init
```
If you went with a `.` for a project name then just proceed with:
```
yarn run husky-init
```
This will configure husky & commitizen to automatically prettify and lint your files as well as commit by the conventional commit [standard.](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Best commit practices for me are:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit
```
After `$ git commit` the terminal will call husky pre-commit hook which will lint all files. 
Then husky will call the prepare-commit-msg which on its side will prompt the commitizen conventional commit interface.

Lastly, of course, after selecting the type of commit and commit message we need to push our changes.
```
$ git push
```
# Great job!
